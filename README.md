# hello-world
Just going through the git-hub tutorial~ ^^ 

A tiny segement about myself?
Wellll... Just a college student who enjoys coding xD and loves math.
I have written a few python codes involving math and many other topics.  
I'll upload them once I get around on figuring out how this thing works. :/ ;D
//Still an amateur in coding though. Looking forward to tumbling upon and grasping new information with time :D

I'm so lazy, yet ambitious. 

I guess this will do... have a great day random passer-by.
